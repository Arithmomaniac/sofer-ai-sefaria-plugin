a good roadmap might look like:
- Embed MP3 player and get Sofer.ai transcript for a manually pasted link
- Add the linker and add links to transcript
- Make links open new tabs
- Make links open flyouts
- Now make links scroll to place if "in scope" (needs definition)
- Make transcript auto-scroll to place in MP3

Further ideas that are kind of off this "main feature path":
- Add to source sheet (whole MP3 and/or transcript)
- Add transcript selection to source sheet
- Push edits (including "current ref") upstream
